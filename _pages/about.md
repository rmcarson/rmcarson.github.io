Hello! I’m a psychiatry resident at [NYU](https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/psychiatry/education/residency-programs/psychiatry-residency) interested in public and community psychiatry. I’m particularly proud to be doing much of my training at Bellevue Hospital, one of the city’s core safety net hospitals. 

My focus right now is figuring out how we can deliver excellent mental health care in under-resourced health systems, both domestically and internationally. Over the years I’ve worked in a variety of academic, government, and nonprofit settings learning how to accomplish change at scale. Some of my interests include implementation science, evidence-based medicine, psychosis, and integrated care models.

I graduated from the [Columbia Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons](https://www.vagelos.columbia.edu/education/academic-programs/md-program) in 2023. Prior to medical school I completed a master’s degree in public policy at the [University of Chicago Harris School](https://harris.uchicago.edu/). I’m originally from Colorado and received my B.A. in International Studies and Public Policy from the [University of Denver](https://korbel.du.edu/) in 2016, where I was a [Boettcher Scholar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boettcher_Scholarship).
